### Data flow design
#### I used MySQL in this project: 

1. <b>MySQL</b>: it is used for persistent long term data storage, where all the data eventually is stored, 
to avoid racing conditions: (update the chats_count, messages_count) I used the hocks or callback to handel the before and after action to increase in case on creating and decrease in case of destroy 


### Services

1. Elasticsearch and Searchkick: for searching through messages content
2. MySQL
